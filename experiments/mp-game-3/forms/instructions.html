  <h2><center>Instructions</center></h2>
  <p>
    You are on a new planet called Crittun, studying creatures with a wudsy detector. The wudsy detector will tell you whether or not a creature is <it>wudsy</it>. 
    Your goal is to learn how to identify creatures that are wudsy. You will be assigned the role of "explorer" or "student". 
    <br> <br>
    If you are the explorer, you will receive the wudsy detector and participate in a series of trials.
    On each trial, you will make a guess as to whether or not a new creature belongs to the category, and then use the detector to find out if you were right.
    If you guess incorrectly, you will have to wait 5 seconds before using the detector again. 
    We will keep a log of all the creatures you see and put a box around the ones that belonged to the detector's category.
    After playing through this series of trials, you will be asked to communicate your findings about wudsy creatures to your student. 
    <br> <br>
    If you are the student, you will wait for a few minutes until the explorer has completed playing through trials with the assistance of the wudsy detector.
    Then you both will enter a chatroom, where you must communicate for at least 30 seconds. You can chat for as long as you need to properly discuss the properties of wudsy creatures.
    After the student and explorer chat about the wudsy creatures, both of you will be given a series of trials, where you must identify creatures as wudsy or not, without the help of the detector.
    <br> <br>
    You will receive a score at the end of these trials, according to the number of creatures you corectly identified. This will be added to the number of creatures that your partner identified correctly to determine a total score for both players.
    For each point in the totasl score, you will each get <b> a bonus of $0.02 per point</b>, so pay attention and communicate effectively with your partner during the chatroom! (Your score cannot go below 0 so you cannot lose any money.)
  </p>

	<p> A few final notes: If you are playing with
	  another player, you may see this screen before the game
	  begins:
	<p>
	  <center><img src="images/Waitroom.png" alt="initial wait screen" style="width:700px;height:150px">
	  </center>
	</p>
	Just hold tight. Another player should join the game within
	the next few minutes. If you're in the waiting room 15 minutes
	without another player joining, please email us to let us know
	(schopra8@stanford.edu).
	</p>

	<p>
	  Second, please be respectful of the worker you're playing
	  with: try to be as responsive as possible.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Finally, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once
	  you start the game (including the waiting page). If you
	  refresh, you will not be able to rejoin the game you were in
	  and you may not be able to submit the HIT. <br> Thank you!
	</p>
