# Game 5

## Structure
1. 1 - 5 critters are presented on screen and subject must identify the critter as belonging / not belonging to the given critter title, e.g. "wudsy".
1. Previous trials are kept on the screen, throughout the duration of the game
1. After 25 rounds of a single concept, a "moving on to the next concept" slide is shown and the process begins again with another concept. There are 3 concepts in total.

## Note
1. Each concept is taught by presenting a series of pre-generated trials. In the original paper, there are 2 lists per concept, where the value of discrimination, e.g. blue versus green, is different between the two lists. We don't do that here. There is only one list of pre-generated trials per concept.

2. Concepts:
    - Fin Color Orange (Easy) --> Original Paper: Blue
    - Body Size Small and Body Color Blue (Medium)   ---> Original Paper: Size 1 and Blue
    - Fin Color Green XOR Body Color Blue (Hard) ---> Original Paper: Circle XOR Blue


## TODOS
- Add 5 second delay on failure to correctly label species
