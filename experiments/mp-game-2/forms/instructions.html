	<h2><center>Save the Wildlife!</center>  </h2>

	<p>
	  In this experiment you will be paired with another turker with the goal of saving endangered wildlife! You are going to a newly discovered island called Critter Island, and it has new species you and your partner have never encountered.

    In each round, you and your partner will learn about two different kinds of wildlife that can help one another.
    Each of you will learn about one kind of wildlife and then teach each other about them.
    Later, <strong>your partner will have to select wildlife from the ones that you studied, and vice versa</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The wildlife you study will look like these:
	</p>

	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/blue egg.png" alt="Example objects"
		 style="width:200px; height:200px" border="1px solid black">
		<tr style="display=inline">
		<img src="images/yellow egg.png" alt="Example objects"
		 style="width:200px; height:200px" border="1px solid black">
		 <tr>
		 <img src="images/purple.png" alt="Example objects"
		 style="width:200px; height:200px" border="1px solid black">
	  </center>
	</p>

	<p>
    The name of the kind of wildlife appears below it, as does whether or not it has a <b>hidden property</b>.
    This hidden property is important for saving the endangered wildlife.
    In the example above, both the oller and the ellep show an egg below: this is their hidden property.
    In the game, you will have to click on the wildlife to reveal whether or not it has a hidden property.
	</p>

	<p>
    The wildlife that you and your partner see will be <b>different</b>.
    Your task is to study the wildlife so that you can teach your partner about them.
    When studying the wildlife, <b>you must click on all of them</b> (revealing whether or not they have a hidden property) to be allowed to move on.
    After studying, you will meet with your partner in a chatroom and discuss what you both have learned.
    Throughout the experiment, you may have to wait for a short period while your partner catches up with you.
	</p>

	<p>
    While in the chat room, you can discuss what you learned. 
    You will be in the chat room for at least 30 seconds.
    After 30 seconds, a button will appear for Player B that they may push to advance the experiment <strong>for both of you</strong>.
    You and your partner can chat for as long as you need to make sure you both learn.
  </p>

  <p>
    After chatting, you will have to <strong>select the wildlife with the hidden feature</strong>.
    The wildlife you select are from the ones that your partner learned about. They will be in a different order from what your partner saw.
    You will not be able to see the hidden features during this stage, but you will see the names.
    The goal is to select the wildlife with the hidden feature <strong>and</strong> to not select the ones without the hidden feature.
    You will get 1 point for each critter you correctly select that has the hidden feature and 1 point for each critter you don't select that doesn't have the hidden feature.
    After each round you will see how many points both you and your partner received.
  </p>

  <p>
    You and your partner's points will be combined at the end for a total score.
    For each point in the total score, you will each get <b> a bonus of $0.02 per point </b>, so
    pay attention!
  </p>

	<p>
    After collecting critters, you will immediately proceed to the next round, where the learning--chat--collecting sequence will repeat.
    In total, there are 4 rounds.
	</p>

	<p> A few final notes: First, since you are playing with
	  another player, you may see this screen before the game
	  begins:
	<p>
	  <center><img src="images/Waitroom.png" alt="initial wait screen"
=
		       style="width:700px;height:150px">
	  </center>
	</p>
	Just hold tight. Another player should join the game within
	the next few minutes. If you're in the waiting room 15 minutes
	without another player joining, please email us to let us know
	(mtessler@stanford.edu).
	</p>

	<p>
	  Second, please be respectful of the worker you're playing
	  with: try to be as responsive as possible. Please do not take notes -- just use your mind!
	</p>

	<p>
	  Finally, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once
	  you start the game (including the waiting page). If you
	  refresh, you will not be able to rejoin the game you were in
	  and you may not be able to submit the HIT. <br> Thank you!
	</p>
