1. Game-2
- Single player, observe 12 critters (4 x 3 species)
- 2 sets of distributions:
  - [1, 1, 0.25], [1, 1, 0.5]
  - Category 1 has 100% color1, Category 2 has 100% color2, Category 3 has 25% or 50% color3 (remainder is color1 or color2)
- 2 prompts
  - Listener will have to "find feps" vs. "find all of the feps"
- n = 9 x 4 = 36 ($0.75) --> $27 + 5.4 (20%) = $32.40
